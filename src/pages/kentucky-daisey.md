Nannita Regina H. Daisey, also known as Kentucky Daisey, was an American woman best known for exaggerated tales of how she staked the first homestead claim during the Oklahoma Land Rush. After staking her claim in the newly established town of Guthrie, she helped other women to claim homesteads. Nannita also helped to found public schools in the new towns that sprang up in the Oklahoma Territory.[^1]

In one account, published in local, regional, and national newspapers, Daisey was said to have jumped from the front of one of the first trains into the Territory, staked her land claim, and reboarded the speeding train before could pass her by. Other versions of the legend have her leaping from the locomotive engine’s cowcatcher.

The Kentucky Daisey Suite is located on the inn’s second floor.
