Lucille Mulhall (October 21, 1885&zwj;&hairsp;&zwj;&ndash;&zwj;&hairsp;&zwj;December 21, 1940) was a famous cowgirl and Wild West performer. She was raised on her family’s Mulhall Ranch in the Oklahoma Territory, near what is now Mulhall, Oklahoma.

As one of the first women to compete with men in roping and riding events, Lucy was known as *Rodeo Queen*, *Queen of the Western Prairie*, and *Queen of the Saddle*, among other names.[^1]

The Lucy Mulhall Suite’s decor reflects Lucy’s Wild West heritage. It is located on the inn’s second floor.
