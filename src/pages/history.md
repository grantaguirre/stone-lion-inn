The 8000 square foot, four-story Stone Lion Inn was built as a private residence in 1907 by F. E. Houghton.[^1][^2] Prior to that they had lived on the property in a small shotgun house. The cost to build was $11,900, or $407,133 in 2024 dollars.[^2]

The family had twelve children; all but one, Irene, survived into adulthood. Legend states that either Irene or Augusta died at the age of seven or eight when either a nurse or a maid accidentally gave an incorrect dose of cough medicine. Others say she died of whooping cough.

It’s most likely that Irene actually died in infancy.[^3] F.E. and his wife also eventually died in the home; after this the family, having fallen into financial straits, moved to Enid.[^1] Augusta, who is often identified as the ghost of the dead child, lived into adulthood.[^3]

In the 1920s the mansion became first a boarding house, then the Smith Funeral Home. Some time later it reverted to being a boarding house. In the 1950s the Walker family purchased and moved into the home. Becky Luker purchased the home in 1986 to renovate and convert it into the present bed and breakfast, renaming it the Stone Lion Inn.

The first reports of ghosts or other paranormal sightings date to after Luker purchased the home. Luker initially identified the child who died at home as Augusta, but later said she was mistaken and that it was Irene.[^3] In either case, the story persisted that the ghost was that of one of these two children (as we previously noted, Augusta survived into adulthood).[^3]

The current proprietor, Grant Aguirre-Y-Luker, says he’s mostly a skeptic, able to rationalize the strange sounds and occurrences reported on the property. Even so, there is one thing he cannot explain. <q>Over the years, we’ve probably gone through 12 or 13 [alarm systems], and they’ve never been successfully set. Something trips them every single time when we’ll get over to the other side of town, and we’ll have some alarm going off</q>[^4]
